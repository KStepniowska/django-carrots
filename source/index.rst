Django Carrots tutorial
=======================

You have in front of you a guide to learn Python and Django. Even if you can not even program, by following the guide and doing all the exercises  you should be able to create your own website and integrate it with Facebook.

The guide is a part of the workshop Django Carrots organized by Geek Girls Carrots. You can use it to organize your own workshops or for self-study. If you decide to use a guide, we will be grateful for the contact (this is not required).
